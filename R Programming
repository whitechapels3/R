# Week2 Assignment
# Write a function named 'pollutantmean' that calculates the mean of a pollutant (sulfate or nitrate) across a specified list of monitors. 
# The function 'pollutantmean' takes three arguments: 'directory', 'pollutant', and 'id'. 
# Given a vector monitor ID numbers, 'pollutantmean' reads that 
# monitors' particulate matter data from the directory specified in the 'directory' argument 
# and returns the mean of the pollutant across all of the monitors, ignoring any missing values coded as NA. 
# A prototype of the function is as follows

pollutantment <- function(directory, pollutant, id = (x:y)){
  filename <- list.files("~/Downloads/specdata", full.names= TRUE)
  df <- data.frame()
  for (i in id){
    dataset <- read.csv(filename[i])
    df <- rbind(df, dataset)
  }
  means <- mean(df[ ,pollutant], na.rm =  TRUE)
  return(means)
}


# Write a function that reads a directory full of files and reports the number of completely observed cases in each data file. 
# The function should return a data frame where the first column is the name of the file 
# and the second column is the number of complete cases. A prototype of this function follows

complete <- function(directory, id ){
  nobs <- function(id){
    filename <- list.files("~/Downloads/specdata", full.names= TRUE)
    df <- read.csv(filename[id])
    return(sum(complete.cases(df)))
  }
  return(data.frame(id = id, nobs = sapply(id, nobs)))
}

# Write a function that takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases 
# and calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations 
# where the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is greater than the threshold. 
# The function should return a vector of correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold requirement. 
# If no monitors meet the threshold requirement, then the function should return a numeric vector of length 0. 
# A prototype of this function follows

corr <- function(directory, threshold = 0){
  filename <- list.files("~/Downloads/specdata", full.names= TRUE)
  cor_vec <- numeric()
  for (i in 1: 332){
    df <- read.csv(filename[i])
    df <- df[complete.cases(df),]
    sumdf <- nrow(df)
    if (sumdf > threshold){
      cor_vec <- c(cor_vec, cor(df$sulfate, df$nitrate))
    }
  } 
  cor_vec
}
